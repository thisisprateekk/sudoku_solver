Sudoku Solver - a small python project

This project implements a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. The solver can handle Sudoku puzzles with empty cells represented by ‘x’. The code is written in Python and includes functions to search for empty cells, 
validate guesses according to Sudoku rules, and solve the puzzle.

Features
Search Empty Cells: Identifies the row and column of the first empty cell in the puzzle.
Validate Guesses: Ensures that each guess adheres to Sudoku rules, checking rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.
Backtracking Algorithm: Efficiently solves the puzzle by making guesses and backtracking when necessary.

Code Explanation
search_empty_rc(puzzle): Searches for the first empty cell in the puzzle.
valid_sudoku(puzzle, guess, row, col): Checks if a guess is valid according to Sudoku rules.
solve_sudoku(puzzle): Solves the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

Example Output
The solver will print True if the puzzle is solvable and display the solved puzzle. If the puzzle is unsolvable, it will print False.
